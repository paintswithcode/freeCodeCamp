# Legacy Python for Everybody
Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.

## Python for Everybody description
>Python for everybody is a free video course series that teaches the basics of using Python 3.

>The courses were created by Dr. Charles Severance (also known as Dr. Chuck). He is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information, where he teaches various technology-oriented courses including programming, database design, and web development.

### Introduction: Why Program?
[Course source link: lessons, resources, etc - PY4E.com](https://www.py4e.com/)
Course is maintained by instructor Charles R. Severance and based on eponymous book *Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3*.

* Data, information and networks are our problems to solve when we develop software on behalf of the users, who want to do something without taking the time and energy to figure out how.

[  ] install Python -- and IDE Options:
* Local installation (python.org)
	* Win: As you install Python, make sure to check the "Add Python 3.5 to PATH" so that you can type **python** at the command line prompt to run it.
	* Have a text editor ([Brackets](https://brackets.io/), etc.)
	* You can also set up Python under Windows-10 using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) if you prefer a Linux-like experience on your windows computer.
* Cloud / browser based - no installation required
	-   [Replit.com](https://replit.com/@ChuckSeverance/PY4E?v=1#main.py) -- Use this course template to get a jump start -- Pricing bumps up to $20/mo.
	-   [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) -- They have a free level that will cover all of your needs for this course through Chapter 15 -- Pricing bumps up to $5..12/mo.
	- Other cloud-provided Python environments include [Trinket](http://trinket.io/), [Cloud9](http://c9.io/), or [CodeAnywhere](http://codeanywhere.com/).
* Both cloud options utilize Linux Shell, so get comfortable with Bash commands
* [According to Geeks4Geeks, the best Python IDE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-python-ide-and-code-editors-in-2020/)s are:
	1. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) -- $99/yr.
	2. [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) -- mainly used by data scientists who can integrate with [Matplotlib](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/matplotlib-tutorial/), SciPy, [NumPy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-numpy/), [Pandas](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pandas-tutorial/), Cython, IPython, SymPy, et al.
	3. [Eclipse PyDev](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pydev-python-ide-eclipse) -- written in Java but you can install the Pydev plugin in eclipse and use it for Python as well.
	4. [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) 
	5. [Wing](https://wingware.com/)

#### Running a program from the <abbr title="command line interface">CLI</abbr>
Type "python" in Win CLI to open python CLI. To run a program:

	python firstprog.py

or

    firstprog.py

### Introduction: Hardware Architecture
* CPU = microprocessor (MPU) = brains, fast, seeking instructions
* Memory stick (RAM) = very fast memory, lost when power 0
	*Software runs on CPU + RAM
	* CPU runs hot because so fast.
	* Microprocessors are essentially same architecture as CPU, but all the capacitors, resistors, transistors are micro-rendered 3D using photographic printing technology.
